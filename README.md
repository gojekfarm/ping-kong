## Description

ProbeD is a transparent health checker service which sits beside a loadbalancer and dynamically remove the upstream services for which health checks fails, Probed is scalable and check health checks asynchronously.

- It currently supports Kong but can be easily extend to any other loadbalancer like haproxy and nginx.
- It support both http and tcp checks.


## Problem it Solves 

Kong prior to .12 does not have health checks and there is no way to remove the faulty upstream servers, which can result in failure of requests while deploying or during maintenance mode.

Probed can be run as side car or co process with Kong and supplement it for the auto removal of the unavailable upstream servers and can help in implementing rolling deployments.

## Installation

```
go get -u github.com/gojektech/probed
```

## Deployment 

ProbeD can be deployed as co process/sidecar with the load balancer (Kong) like following diagram, where it automatically fetch the upstream servers and remove those if health check fails.
